Here are some tips for using Flutter & instructions for this project: 
-Usually, we separate the code because it will increase the overall performance.

Of course, you mostly going to work with the lib folder the rest folder are for the backend development
We separated the app into four main folders the lib folder is divided as follow:
 
    1- Data folder, which contains the data. 
    2- Models folder, contain the project classes & the AdSense code.
    3- Screen folder, contain the actual screen displayed on the phone.
    4- Widget folder, contain the widgets, those widgets then have been called into the screen. 
    lastly the main file. This file contains the font, colour theming and the app run function.

More details of the functions and the code added into the code.
